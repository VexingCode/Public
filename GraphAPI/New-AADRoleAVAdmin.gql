# Body
# The "templateId": "GUID" is an optional parameter that's sent in the body depending on the requirement. If you have a requirement to create multiple different custom roles with common parameters, it's best to create a template and define a templateId value. You can generate a templateId value beforehand by using the PowerShell cmdlet (New-Guid).Guid.
